On this rep, I will upload my school files. Other files, like mindstorm, are on the Digi-X page.

## Scripting
We started this course with learning how to script in Python. Over the course of the classes I'll update the scripts we make. Mostly to have it all sorted for myself, but maybe you find something you could use, or need. If you have any tips, just make a comment or get in contact with me, I'm open to all help regarding scripting etc..

## Test!
